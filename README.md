 # Trial of The Spear
 An arena shooter inspired by Boomerang X where I attempted to really refine a satisfying movement and combat system.
 # Datamoshing Effect
 A real-time data moshing effect in Unity and a short Ghostrunner-inspired game to go along with it.
 # OpenGL Physarum Simulation
 A Compute Shader Physarum simulation that I implemented in my attempts to learn OpenGL.
